# Personal Portfolio - Final Project - [Code The Dream](www.codethedream.org)

## Overview

This project teach me how to build my own personal portfolio website step-by-step. Be encouraged to really personalize this project using my own creativity and interests.

Each lesson was an individual assignment, but I worked out at the same repository for the entire project. 

## How it was?

#1 **Section 2:** I learnt Git Basics

### **Section 3:** How the Web Works

- [Lesson 3.1: How the Web Works](instructions/section-3/lesson-3-1.md)

### **Section 4:** Web Basics

- [Lesson 4.1: HTML Basics](instructions/section-4/lesson-4-1.md)
- [Lesson 4.2: JavaScript and the DOM](instructions/section-4/lesson-4-2.md)
- [Lesson 4.3: HTML Forms and DOM Practice](instructions/section-4/lesson-4-3.md)
- [Lesson 4.4: CSS Basics](instructions/section-4/lesson-4-4.md)
- [Lesson 4.5: CSS Layout](instructions/section-4/lesson-4-5.md)

### **Section 5:** How the Internet Works

- [Lesson 5.1: How the Internet Works and Debugging](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/intro-to-programming-section-5/blob/main/README.md)

**NOTE:** Section 5 is a debugging exercise.  Clicking the above link takes you to a second Code the Dream School repository where a guessing game is already built... but it's not working as expected!  Use the debugging skills you've learned so far in class to find and fix the bugs.  Be sure you fork and clone the section 5 repository like you did in week 6.  BE SURE YOU ARE **NOT** INSIDE YOUR LOCAL FOLDER FOR YOUR PORTFOLIO WHEN YOU CLONE SECTION 5!

### **Section 6:** AJAX Basics

- [Lesson 6.1: AJAX Basics](instructions/section-6/lesson-6-1.md)
- [Lesson 6.2: Working with the Fetch API](instructions/section-6/lesson-6-2.md)
