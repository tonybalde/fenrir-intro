---

## Instructions

### Getting Started:

Merge your pull request from the previous lesson (if you haven't already):

[View tutorial](../common/how-to-merge.md)


Checkout your main branch and pull changes:

    git checkout main
    git pull

Create a new local branch to work on separate from the `main` branch:

    git checkout -b lesson-4-4

Now, open the project directory in your code editor and continue to the next section.

### Task List:

#### Create Stylesheet

- [x] Create a folder called `css/` at the root level (the same level as your instructions and js folders and your index.html file)
- [x] Inside that folder, create a Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) file called `index.css`

#### Link your CSS file to your HTML file

- [x] Open your `index.html` file
- [x] Before the closing `</head>` tag, insert a `<link>` element with a `rel` attribute of "stylesheet" and an `href` attribute that specifies the relative path to your CSS file (i.e. `css/index.css`)
- [x] Save and open the index.html file in your browser

#### Write CSS

For this assignment, there are some general requirements but **the design is up to you!** This is your chance to be creative and transform your webpage into a reflection of who you are.

- [x] Change the background color of the page body
- [x] Change the default text color
- [x] Define the font family for the entire page or just a section
  - (Optional) Load in a font family from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [x] Add spacing (padding/margin) between sections
- [x] Change the font size, weight, and color of all headings
- [x] Transform the "Experience" list items into styled blocks
- [x] Transform the "Skills" list items into styled blocks
- [x] Style the "Leave a Message" form elements
  - Change font size and color of labels
  - Change font size, padding, border, etc. of inputs and textarea
  - Add spacing (padding/margin) between form fields
  - Change padding, background color, border, etc. of submit button
- [x] Transform the "Messages" list items into styled blocks and customize the remove button (and/or edit button if you have one)
- [x] Change the spacing and background color of the footer

**This is the basic rubric, but we encourage you to think beyond this list and come up with your own ideas to make your webpage unique!**

#### STRETCH GOAL
**Optional** The next five checkboxes are not required for this assignment, but if you'd like to practice your file structure building, file linking, HTML and CSS coding skills give it a try:

- [x] Add an `images` folder to the root level
- [x] Add/upload your favorite picture of yourself or a headshot
- [x] In the `index.html` file add an `<img>` tag by your name at the top of your website inside the body
- [x] Use the img tag to add your favorite picture from the images folder to your website
- [x] Use CSS to change the style of your picture (ex. add a border to the picture, or round the edges of the photo, etc.)

**NOTE:** You can also use the above steps to add a background image to a section or the body of your page if you don't want to share a picture of yourself.  Be sure if you use a photo that it's either one you took, or one you have copyright permissions to use.

### Final Step:

Check the status of your local repository to double-check the changes you made:

    git status

Stage the file(s) that you edited:

    git add .

Check the status again and notice that the changes from before are now staged:

    git status

Create a commit for the changes you made and add a message describing the changes you made:

> Note: Replace `<message>` with your message

    git commit -m "<message>"

Push your commit to the remote repository (visible in GitHub):

    git push

Check the log to make sure your commit has been published:

    git log --oneline

Create a pull request and submit:
