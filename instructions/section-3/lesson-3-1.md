## Instructions

### Getting Started:

Merge your pull request from the previous lesson (if you haven't already).  You do NOT need to wait for your reviewer to comment on your last pull request before you merge:

[View tutorial for merging your pull request](../common/how-to-merge.md)


Checkout your main branch and pull changes:

    git checkout main
    git pull

Create a new local branch to work on separate from the `main` branch:

    git checkout -b lesson-3-1

Now, open the project directory in your code editor and continue to the next section.

### Task List:

- [x] Open your `index.html` file

- [x] Add the phrase "About"
- [x] Below that, write a paragraph about yourself
- [x] Add the phrase "Experience"
- [x] Below that, write a list of places you've worked or projects you've worked on
- [x] Add the phrase "Connect"
- [x] Below that, paste links to your email, GitHub, social media, etc.

- [x] Copy the file path to your `index.html` file
- [x] Paste the path in your web browser and you should see all the text you just wrote

Next week we will learn how to structure this content!

### Final Step:

Check the status of your local repository to double-check the changes you made:

    git status

Stage the file(s) that you edited:

    git add .

Check the status again and notice that the changes from before are now staged:

    git status

Create a commit for the changes you made and add a message describing the changes you made:

> Note: Replace `<message>` with your message (example - "added info in index.html file")

    git commit -m "<message>"

Push your commit to the remote repository (visible in GitHub):

    git push

Check the log to make sure your commit has been published:

    git log --oneline

Create a pull request and submit:
